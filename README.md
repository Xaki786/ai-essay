# Assessment:
You’re working on an application that gives users an AI Essay. The product person on your team has stated that our machine learning team needs more feedback from users about the essays, and our product team needs more feedback from users about the site. They also would like to increase the number of reviews written about our website. He has created a task for you below:

## Ticket:
#### GOAL: 
Get as much feedback as possible from our users about the essay results and our website. Users that give the best feedback should be asked to write a review.
#### TASK: 
Above the essay, create a feedback section that asks users for a 1-5 star rating on the essay, then a 1-5 star rating about the site, and finally, if the user submitted 5 stars for both, ask the user to leave us a review on a 3rd party (like TrustPilot). Make sure to track (with an example/mock function) when the user clicks the “leave us a review” button.

#### Instructions: 
Total coding time should be limited to 45-60 minutes. It is NOT necessary to fully complete the coding task. Use create react app (typescript preferred) to create this assessment app page which includes only a sample essay and your feedback component logic. Add a sample Essay component with sample text (such as lorum ipsum) to showcase where the essay will be positioned in comparison to your feedback component. As a mid-senior developer, you should consider every aspect of a ticket as it pertains to the goal. Feel free to change the task in ANY way to improve the company’s chances of reaching the goal. STOP coding anywhere between 45-60 minutes. At this point, you will “hand the task” over to another developer/team member. Please write down a message to the developer including EVERYTHING they need to know to complete the task. You can also add code comments after time has passed if that makes it easier. Your message should include unfinished functions, backend endpoints (if applicable), and anything to watch out for or look into. BEFORE starting the task, spend at least a few minutes thinking it over. The purpose of this last step is to get the task fully "finished" as it pertains to your end.

#### Deliverables:
- your code as zip file, or github link
- message to the fellow developer
- screen shots (only the feedback component will be considered for visual effect)
